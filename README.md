# Overview

Based on the original [Tool to convert OpenFoam mesh to SU2 mesh (2D and 3D)](https://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/su2/127445-tool-convert-openfoam-mesh-su2-mesh-2d-3d.html),
I modified the source code to be compatible with OpenFOAM v2212 mesh in `tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/airFoil2D`.
